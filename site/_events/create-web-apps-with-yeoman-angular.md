[Karma Laboratory](http://karma-laboratory.com/) + [DevConfig](https://devconfig.org/) present:

#### Yeoman + AngularJS: A hands-on workshop

* Are you new to developing apps for the web?
* Know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery but looking to go further?
* Want to learn some tips & tricks about command line tools?
* Plus, how to set up a web app using a [MVC design pattern](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#whatisapattern)?
* How about all of the above in a fun and social environment?

**Then join us on Thursday, May 1st for an evening of hands-on coding!**

In a mere 3 hours we will build a fully functional web app using an awesome command-line tool called [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and an equally awesome JavaScript MVC framework called [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

*(If you want a sneak peak at what will be covered in the workshop, have a quick scroll through this tutorial: [yeoman.io/codelab](http://yeoman.io/codelab). Don't worry if some of it might seem scary -- we'll have experienced mentors on hand to make sure you don't get stuck.)*

Please RSVP now on the [EventBrite Registration Page](http://yeoman-angular.eventbrite.com). tickets are flying fast!

See you there!

#### More details:

The wonderful folks at [HackerYou](http://hackeryou.com/) will be hosting us at their Learning Labs space at Queen & Spadina. Doors open at 6:00pm and a light dinner will be supplied.

**Please bring:**

* Your **laptop** and charger
  * It is **very** important for this workshop that you have administrative rights to your laptop  
  *(e.g. You know all the passwords and have no security issues with installing new software.)*
* A **tablet** is recommended
  *(So you can follow along with the instructions without the need to switch screens away from the code)*
* A **3G/4G hotspot** would be helpful 
  *(WiFi will be available and accessible by all, however due to the numbers we cannot guarantee high performance, if you have a data plan, it might be faster for you to go with that option.)*
