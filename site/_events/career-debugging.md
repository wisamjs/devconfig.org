From shell scripts to IDEs, we programmers spend a lot of time finding tools to optimize our development workflow. But how often are you given tools to debug your career?

How do you know that you're in the right position, at the right company, doing the right things for **you**? What does progress in a technical career track look like? Does becoming more senior inevitably mean becoming a manager?

If you've been looking for answers on how to debug your career, kick off 2016 by joining us on the afternoon of Sat, Jan 16 for a unique *dev.config* workshop & panel.

Hear from **Omer Aziz**, Senior Vice President of Human Resources at Sysomos, on how to predictively reproduce "flow" using your strengths rather than your weaknesses.

Don't know your strengths? Not to worry since we'll spend part of the afternoon actually completing an assessment quiz to find out your top 5 strengths.

We'll have time for coffee and mingling. Then close off the afternoon with a panel discussion on career debugging.

Keep an eye on the [#DevConfig #CareerDebugging](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23DevConfig%20%23CareerDebugging&src=typd) hashtags and [devconfig.org](http://devconfig.org/) for panelists announcements, and a special Twitter chat leading up to the in-person event to submit your own questions and offer your insights.
