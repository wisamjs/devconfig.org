We at Bower Labs (not to be confused with that other [Bower](http://bower.io/)!) are proud to support the [Yeoman Tooling Hackathon](/events/yeoman-tooling-hackathon/) in Toronto along with [GitHub](http://github.com/) and [Bitmaker Labs](http://bitmakerlabs.com/). It's a great way to give back to the community that creates the tools we all use to build modern web applications.

If you haven't already, [reserve your spot](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Yeoman-User-Group/events/190852932/)!
