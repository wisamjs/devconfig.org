Announcing the [Yeoman Toronto User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Yeoman-User-Group/), and its new home on the web: [yeoman.to](http://yeoman.to)

### What is Yeoman?

With so many great tools available to front-end web developers these days it can sometimes be difficult to understand how they all fit together. Deciding on a workflow that you're happy with is often a very personal endeavour, but getting started isn't always easy. Yeoman aims to solve this problem by scaffolding workflows for creating modern webapps, while at the same time mixing in many of the best practices that have evolved within the industry.

#### Enter [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)

Our workflow is comprised of three tools for improving your **productivity** and **satisfaction** when building a web app: *yo* (the scaffolding tool), *grunt* (the build tool) and *bower* (for package management).

* [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) scaffolds out a new application, writing your Grunt configuration and pulling in relevant Grunt tasks and Bower dependencies that you might need for your build.

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used to build, preview and test your project, thanks to help from tasks curated by the Yeoman team and grunt-contrib.

* [Bower](http://bower.io/) is used for dependency management, so that you no longer have to manually download and manage your scripts.
All three of these tools are developed and maintained separately, but work well together as part of our prescribed workflow for keeping you effective.

### Why this group

A Toronto meetup group for anyone interested in building & learning modern workflows for modern webapps using Yeoman. All skill levels are welcome!
